# MIDAS
* The repository contains implementaions of Mixed-data sampling (MIDAS)[1]
* Currently, it is based on the package by Jonas Striaukas (https://github.com/jstriaukas/midasml), the language of that package is R. Although it has [Python Version](https://github.com/jstriaukas/midasmlpy), it contains a lot of bugs. In addition, some of the code is also not fully optimized.
* The main goal of this repository is build a python version MIDAS package
* I'll start with debugging the code mentioned before, and try to optimize it. 
* I also have the plan to introduce PyTorch to this repository, which would benefit building a hybrid model combines DNNs and MIDAS together.
